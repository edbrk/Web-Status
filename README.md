## About Web Status System

The Web Status System is a web application built by Edward Brook for his Final Year project at Swansea University studying Computer Science. It was built to bridge the gap between current products in the market. With features such as incident managment, realtime and historic server resource usage and current latency between various locations.

There is three primary parts to the Web Status System. 

1. The Web application (This Respository)
2. The linux monitoring agent: https://github.com/Edbtvplays/Web-Status-Agent
3. Latency Poller (Coming Soon)

The project is currently in heavy active development, and initial working progress may not be seen for a while. Once the application is in a decent state a demo enviroment will be setup to showcase the application.
